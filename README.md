  # hello-world
my first repository on github
I am currently a project manager for a web design company.  I have good fundamental understanding of the web and general tech but would like a much deeper understanding of the nuts and bolts.  I have just scratched the surface of design using photo/video edit software and have begun to play with html and css.  I know this will take a lot of time but I want to stick with it.
